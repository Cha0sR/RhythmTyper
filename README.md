Hello visitor!

You can start playing the game using RhythmTyper.html

This is a game I was inspired to make after trying out Paper.js and Howler.js in Colt Steele's Udemy course. This uses Patatap's sound effects to have you play out beats.

Just match the key when the circle collides! There is a guide to show you the flow of the track once you select one as it is challenging.

Also, feel free to think of any beats and try them out in pata.html or pata2.html

RhythmTyperOG.html is just a reminder from where I started.

Enjoy!
